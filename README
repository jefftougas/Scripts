Scripts I find useful for development

svn-git:

Shorthand scripts for using svn-git when code is mastered in a subversion repository but you want to keep a copy in a remote git repository as well. Note it is "svn-git" because svn is master, git is slave in this case. Also, typing "sgpull" is easier than "gspull"
